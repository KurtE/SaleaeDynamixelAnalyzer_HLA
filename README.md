## Getting started

This HLA works using the Data packets generated by the Serial 
Low Level Analyzer.

The current code for this is located at:
https://github.com/kurte/SaleaeDynamixelAnalyzer_HLA


This is a Play In Progress. I am also using it as a way to learn more
of programming with Python. 

This is an attempt to convert over from my Dynamixel Servo Low Level 
analyzer over to an High Level Analyzer, as to not to need to install
and semi copy of the Serial low level analyzer. 

## what it does

The code is working reasonably well on some of the different cases
I have tried it on, both with Protocol 1 servos (AX12) as well
as Protocol 2 servos (XL430-W250)

I have most of the code working to generate data for both the report and
table views. 

## Warning 

Again this code is a python learning exercise, and probably lots of it
could be done a lot better.    It is also unclear to me how far I will
take it.

And I make no promises or guarantees that this code works or is useful 
in any way shape or form.  But it hope it is.
